             <p class="dark">Fortnite started off as something less than a success. As originally released last July, it was a cooperative third-person shooter with interesting but messy crafting mechanics—a little bit Gears of War, a little bit Minecraft, with some of the cartoonish glee of Team Fortress 2. Then, inspired by the unanticipated success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Epic added a free-to-play "battle royale" mode in September: one hundred players on a large island, fighting for survival, with all the fort-building mechanics of the main game intact. And it exploded.</p>
             <p class="dark">Raking in an estimated $318 million a month, blockbuster video game "Fortnite" is no child's play. The big number you'll see mentioned is that Fortnite has 250 million players in total as of March 2019.</p>

               <h3>Twitch</h3>
               <p>Live streaming of video games has become a popular trend in recent years, and “Fortnite” is taking it to the next level. There are 3.2 million broadcasters on streaming site Twitch, which is close to 60 percent higher than 2017. Since Epic Games launched the battle royale version of “Fortnite,” the game has taken over the site. In September 2017, “Fortnite” made up less than 1 percent of the content produced by streaming channels. Fast forward to June 2018, and that number has jumped to 49 percent.</p>
